# data products from CW searches LIGO-P2100267

We here collect the data products from the O3 narrowband CW searches in the paper
available at https://dcc.ligo.org/P2100267 by the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, the
Virgo Collaboration and the KAGRA Collaboration.

There is data for three figures, as well as for tables 1 and 2:

**figure_1_data.csv:**: data for figure 1 (spindown and observational upper limits) for each target, in the same order as they appear in Table 1.

**figure_7_2F_vals.txt**: data with 2F values for injections for Figure 7.

**figure_7_threshold_outlier.txt**: data for 2F values in Figure 7 that exceed thresholds.

**figure_8_injection_results.txt**: data with 2F values for injections for Figure 8.

**figure_8_outlier_results.txt**: data for 2F values in Figure 8 for outliers.

**search_setup_table.csv**: table 1 data in machine readable format (zeros indicate missing entries)

**upper_limits_table.csv**: table 2 data in machine readable format (zeros indicate missing entries)
